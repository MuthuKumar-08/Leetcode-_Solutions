/*
Approach:
- This problem is solved using Depth First Search (DFS) with backtracking.
- Start from node 0 (source) and explore all possible paths until reaching
  the last node (target = graph.size() - 1).
- Maintain a `path` vector to store the current traversal path.
- Whenever the current node equals the target, store the path in `result`.
- After exploring a node, backtrack by removing the last node from `path`
  to explore other possible paths.
- Since the graph is a DAG, no visited array is required.

Time Complexity:
- O(P * L), where P is the number of paths and L is the average path length.

Space Complexity:
- O(L), due to recursion stack and path storage.
